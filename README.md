# RX
Reactive Java

This is source code I wrote when I was following a book called Reactive Java in Action. I was learning reactive programming hopping it will help me on an android app I was building in Java. But with the advent of Android Architecture components, LiveData and lifecycle libraries, I never got to apply the knowledge of RxJava. When Kotlin came knocking, it was time to let go of RxJava for now or then.
